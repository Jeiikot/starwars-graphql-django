## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_user/starwars-graphql-django.git
   cd starwars-graphql-django
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create the database and run migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Load real Star Wars data automatically from SWAPI:**
   ```bash
     python manage.py load_starwars_data
   ```
   > **Tip:** This command fetches all characters, movies, and planets from the [public SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/), and loads them into your local database.

6. **(Optional) Run with Docker:**
   ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
   ```
   > Docker is fully supported for local development and testing.

7. **Start the development server (if not using Docker):**
   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
   ```

## üîé Using the API (GraphQL Playground)

Open [`http://localhost:8000/graphql/`](http://localhost:8000/graphql/) in your browser to access the **GraphiQL** interface.  
You can explore the full API schema, run queries/mutations, and view in-code documentation.

---

### üß© Example Query: List Characters

```graphql
{
  allCharacters(name_Icontains: "luke") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        birthYear
        species
        homeworld { name }
        movies {
          edges {
            node {
              title
              openingCrawl
              director
              producers
              planets { edges { node { name } } }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Example Mutation: Create Character

```graphql
mutation {
  createCharacter(
    name: "Ahsoka Tano",
    species: "Togruta",
    birthYear: "36BBY",
    homeworld: "<PLANET_ID>",
    movies: ["<MOVIE_ID_1>", "<MOVIE_ID_2>"]
  ) {
    character {
      id
      name
      homeworld { name }
      movies { edges { node { title } } }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### üåç Example Mutation: Create Planet

```graphql
mutation {
  createPlanet(
    name: "Kamino",
    climate: "temperate",
    terrain: "ocean",
    population: "1000000"
  ) {
    planet {
      id
      name
      climate
    }
  }
}
```

---

### üé¨ Example Mutation: Create Movie

```graphql
mutation {
  createMovie(
    title: "The Mandalorian",
    episodeId: 10,
    openingCrawl: "A new story in the galaxy...",
    director: "Jon Favreau",
    producers: "Dave Filoni, Jon Favreau",
    releaseDate: "2023-12-12",
    planets: ["<PLANET_ID_1>"]
  ) {
    movie {
      id
      title
      director
      planets { edges { node { name } } }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
  pytest
```
---

## üõ°Ô∏è Test Coverage

To run the tests with coverage, use:

```bash
  pytest --cov=starwars
```

To generate a coverage HTML report:

```bash
  pytest --cov=starwars --cov-report=html
```

Then open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to see the coverage report.

---

## üìö API Technical Documentation

- The API is fully self-documented via the **GraphiQL** explorer at [`/graphql/`](http://localhost:8000/graphql/).
- Each type, query, and mutation includes docstrings that appear as inline documentation in GraphiQL.
- All usage examples (queries, mutations) are available here and in GraphiQL.
- Automated data seeding from SWAPI simplifies onboarding and demos.

> **Note:** Swagger and Redoc are REST standards; for GraphQL, **interactive schema documentation** is the norm.

---

## üê≥ Docker Support

Build and start the project using Docker with:

```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```

All dependencies and environment setup are managed for you. Great for quick onboarding and teamwork.

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment (Gunicorn)

For production environments, use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) as your WSGI server:

```bash
   gunicorn api.starwars.wsgi
```
